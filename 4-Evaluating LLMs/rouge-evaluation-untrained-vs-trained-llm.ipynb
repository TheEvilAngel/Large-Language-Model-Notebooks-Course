these results, I would say that the fine-tuned model performs slightly better than the T5-Base model. It consistently achieves higher ROUGE scores in all metrics except for LSUM, where the difference is minimal.\n\nAdditionally, the ROUGE metrics are quite interpretable. \n\nLSUM indicates the percentage of the longest common subsequence, regardless of word order, in relation to the total length of the text. \n\nThis can be a good indicator of overall similarity between texts. However, both models have very similar LSUM scores, and the fine-tuned model has better scores in other ROUGE metrics.\n\nPersonally, I would lean towards the fine-tuned model, although the difference may not be very significant.\n\n## Continue learning\nThis notebook is part of a [course on large language models](https://github.com/peremartra/Large-Language-Model-Notebooks-Course) I'm working on and it's available on [GitHub](https://github.com/peremartra/Large-Language-Model-Notebooks-Course).
